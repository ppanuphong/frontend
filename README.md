# BDI KKU NMR Astro Frontend Workstation
=====================================

This folder contains the **high-performance single-page web client** for the AI NMR Spectroscopy Workstation, built with the modern Astro framework. 

It communicates directly with the GPU-accelerated FastAPI backend on port 8000 and features premium styling, interactive zoomable Plotly charts, and a client-side laboratory file ingestion engine.

## ⚡ Core UI Technologies & Features

1. **Forced Premium Light Theme**: Designed specifically for clinical utility with Slate-Gray layouts, crisp white glass cards, and amber/emerald warning badges to maximize readability under hospital diagnostic lighting.
2. **Unified Single-Page Flow**: Combines patient profile selection, file uploads, real-time biomarker integral abundance tables, zoomable overlay spectrometry canvases, and stacked reference waterfalls in a single, seamless, non-tabbed workflow.
3. **Advanced Client-Side File Ingestion**:
   - Reads standard laboratory CSV/TXT spectral coordinate files on-the-fly via the browser `FileReader` API.
   - Automatically detects delimiters (comma, tab, semicolon, whitespace) and filters out text headers dynamically.
   - Performs high-performance linear interpolation (`np.interp` equivalent) to sort and align raw data onto the model's standard 4,000 points grid (0.0 to 10.0 ppm) in < 2ms.
   - Automatically calculates a real-time **Pearson Correlation Coefficient** to match the uploaded spectrum against standard metabolic profiles, loading the appropriate biomarker references and PubChem links instantly.
4. **Interactive Spectroscopic Workspace**: Powered by Plotly.js to render dual-pane spectroscopy plots, enabling real-time zooming in defined chemical zones (Aliphatic, Carbohydrate, Aromatic) and stacked library comparisons.
5. **Technical Expander Panel**: Keeps the clinician's workspace perfectly tidy by tucking away deep technical telemetries (PyTorch 512-dim latent activations, Euler integration trajectories, EBM gauge dials, ML accuracy comparisons, and EMR hospital JSON EMR payloads) inside a collapsed accordion.
